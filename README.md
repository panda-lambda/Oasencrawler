## Oasencrawler
*A simple 2d game to practice classes in C++. Summer semester 2022 at UAS (FH Technikum Wien)*

The game uses three classes and has one enemy which moves like a tower in chess. Once you get to a danger field (marked by '?') you have to roll the dice, similar to pen & paper mechanics. Once you complete a level, you can upgrade your abilites and health points. There is a total of 10 levels, with increasing difficulty. 

The game was made using CodeBlocks.
